## Reviews

### Pragmatic Programmer

It's a very good book. Sometimes it contains well-known thoughts. At least some
of them were known implicitly by me. But it does the structure and declares
explicitly all of them.

Must read book. I have read the 2000 edition.

### Refacroting

The book is bloated. The author can spend a few pages writing about a variable
renaming. The most useful part is the first four chapters. Talking about
refactoring in common, best practices to do it, and tests.

The rest of the book can be overviewed without great attention. Only the
"Motivation" section can be useful in all these sections.

### The Deadline

I can't decide the quality of the book from the management side since I have no
management experience but it's a book that's easy to read and contains some
interesting information about building a big tech product in an artistic manner.
Book characters come to decisions based on some in-book researchers. I'm not
sure if such researches were done in reality, but if so their results look
exciting. Here I talk about researches about developer productivity under press
or under overtime.

Because it's quite small and easy to read I think you should consider reading
the book.

### The mythical Man-Month

The book contains a lot of exciting information about a project organization for
a tech guy. How a team should be organized to make a consistent system? What
dangerous situation an architecture can meet (the second system)? Which and how
docs can help to create a product? The author touches on a lot of important
questions in the whole process of software development.

Also, the end of the book contains a list of the main points of each chapter +
an overview over 20 years after the first edition of the book.

There are a lot of references for performance measurements and statistics
(almost all of them were done in the past with old technologies, but the
comparison is still useful). But unfortunately, some of them are unavailable
now. For example, I was interested in the proof for one thesis. The author
referenced Lehman and Belady's "Programming system dynamics", given at the ACM
SIGOPS, October 1971, but unfortunately, this article is unavailable on the
Internet.
