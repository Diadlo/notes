## Reviews

### Pragmatic Programmer

It's a very good book. Sometimes it contains well-known thoughts. At least some
of them were known implicitly by me. But it does the structure and declares
explicitly all of them.

Must read book. I have read the 2000 edition.

### Refacroting

The book is bloated. The author can spend a few pages writing about a variable
renaming. The most useful part is the first four chapters. Talking about
refactoring in common, best practices to do it, and tests.

The rest of the book can be overviewed without great attention. Only the
"Motivation" section can be useful in all these sections.

### The Deadline

I can't decide the quality of the book from the management side since I have no
management experience but it's a book that's easy to read and contains some
interesting information about building a big tech product in an artistic manner.
Book characters come to decisions based on some in-book researchers. I'm not
sure if such researches were done in reality, but if so their results look
exciting. Here I talk about researches about developer productivity under press
or under overtime.

Because it's quite small and easy to read I think you should consider reading
the book.
