### Pragmatic Programmer Review

It's a very good book. Sometimes it contains well-known thoughts. At least some
of them were known implicitly by me. But it does the structure and declares
explicitly all of them.

Must read book. I have read the 2000 edition.

### Refacroting Review

The book is bloated. The author can spend a few pages writing about a variable
renaming. The most useful part is the first four chapters. Talking about
refactoring in common, best practices to do it, and tests.

The rest of the book can be overviewed without great attention. Only the
"Motivation" section can be useful in all these sections.
